# FibonacciRevisitedGitHubCopilot
Added one more function helped by GitHub Copilot to generate Fibonacci numbers without overflowing.

The new function does not use the int type.
It uses the BigDecimal data type.
The code is simple but it was generated by GitHub Copilot.
It underwent several passes.

If you are interested in additional comments, I invite

Keep in mind that one of the best ways to learn is to read,
experiment, and repeat. Memorization is not the best approach.

Enjoy;
